# F5J — RC Electric Powered Thermal Duration Gliders

Single-task electric thermal duration; launch height scored as a **deduction**.

## 1. Pilot assignment to groups (the draw)

Common draw rules per parents, plus (`5.5.11.8`):

- Rounds subdivided into frequency-compatible groups; **minimum 6** competitors per
  group. Prefer the **fewest groups per round with the most competitors** each.
- Group composition minimises repeat matchups. **Team protection is mandatory at
  World/Continental Championships, not permitted at Open International / World Cup.**
  Junior pilots get team protection for their nominated helper.
- **Fairness floor:** if a group falls to 5 or fewer (or 4 or fewer in contests ≤30
  pilots) move a competitor up from a later group or cancel and refill (`5.5.11.14.1`).
- **Fly-off:** the top **30 % (rounded down)** of qualifiers, as a **single group of
  minimum 6, maximum 14** (the CD may set a lower maximum).

Working time: **10 minutes** (qualifying) / **15 minutes** (fly-off).

## 2. Data the timer / helper collects

| Field | Precision / rule |
|---|---|
| **Flight time** | **Truncated to the whole second** (`5.5.11.12 b`). Timed from **motor ON** to first ground/object contact or end of working time. |
| **Start height** | Read from the **AMRT**, **truncated to the whole metre** (`5.5.11.12 d`). AMRT initialised on the ground before launch, observed by the timekeeper. Flight = 0 if the AMRT records no start height. |
| **Landing distance** | Nose-to-spot, → landing-bonus table below (`5.5.11.12 h`). |
| **Motor run** | AMRT-limited; the flight is **zeroed** if the propeller keeps turning after the 30-second motor-run period (`5.5.11.7 g`). |
| **Penalties** | e.g. wrong launch direction / motor before start signal / launch not straight-ahead for 3 s −100 each (`5.5.11.10 b, c, e`); safety-area −300; contact in access corridor −1000. Launch outside the ±2 m corridor is a **zero score**, not a −100 penalty (`5.5.11.10 d`). Listed on the round score sheet. |

**Overfly:** score 0 if the model overflies the end of working time by more than 1
minute; no landing bonus if it overflies at all.

**Landing-bonus table** (`5.5.11.12 h`) — note this is a **different, coarser** table
than F3J/F5L:

| Dist (m) | Pts |
|---|---|
| ≤1 | 50 |
| 2 | 45 |
| 3 | 40 |
| 4 | 35 |
| 5 | 30 |
| 6 | 25 |
| 7 | 20 |
| 8 | 15 |
| 9 | 10 |
| 10 | 5 |
| over 10 | 0 |

## 3. Group score (`5.5.11.12`)

**Raw score** per competitor:

```
raw = flight points + landing bonus − start-height deduction
```

- **Flight points:** 1 pt per full second, capped at **600** (qualifying) / **900**
  (fly-off).
- **Start-height deduction:** **0.5 pt per metre up to 200 m**, **3 pt per metre above
  200 m**.
- If the raw total is negative it is recorded as **0** (penalties still apply).

**Normalisation:** highest raw total in the group → **1000**; others =
`own raw × 1000 / group winner's raw`.

---

## 4. Round score

Round score = the normalised group score.

---

## 5. Final classification (`5.5.11.13`)

- Minimum **4** qualifying rounds for a valid contest.
- **Qualifying aggregate:** if **4 or fewer** rounds, sum all; if **more than 4**, the
  **lowest round score is dropped**.
- Top **30 %** → fly-off; fly-off scored as above; **final placing = fly-off aggregate
  only**, qualifying position breaks ties.
- Penalties are cumulative, deducted at the end of the qualifying rounds, and are
  **not** carried into the fly-off.
- Team classification as in the parent.

**Common vs specific:** electric-launch + AMRT, group normalisation and the fly-off
concept are common (parents); F5J specifics are the **whole-second** flight time, the
**start-height deduction (0.5 / 3 pt per m)**, the **50→0 landing table**, the
**600 / 900** flight-point caps, **drop-worst beyond 4 rounds**, and the **top-30 %**
fly-off.

## 6. Re-flights (`5.5.11.6`)

**Entitlement** — the competitor is entitled to a re-flight if:

- his model, in the process of being launched, collides with another model
  being launched;
- his model, in flight, collides with another model in flight;
- the attempt was **not judged** by the timekeeper — provided the
  helper/competitor **informed the timekeeper of the model's position** a
  reasonable time before landing, else no entitlement (likewise if **no time
  was recorded**, `5.5.11.5 d`);
- the attempt was hindered or aborted by an **unexpected event not within his
  control**.

**Claim / waiver:** the competitor must ensure the timekeeper **noted the
hindering condition** and must **land as soon as possible**; continuing to
launch or fly afterwards waives the right to a new working time.

**Placement priorities:**

1. in an **incomplete group**, or a complete group on additional
   launching/landing spots;
2. failing that, in a **new group of minimum 6 re-flyers** (note: 6, not the
   4 used by F3J/F3K/F5K), made up by random draw (re-drawn if frequency/team
   doesn't fit or the drawn pilot won't fly);
3. failing that, with the **original group at the end of the ongoing round**.

**Which score counts** (cases 2 and 3): competitors **allocated the re-flight
score the re-flight** (official even if worse); the other pilots in the group
score the **better of** their ongoing-round score and the re-flight score. A
pilot not allocated the new attempt gets no further working time if the
re-flight is hindered.
